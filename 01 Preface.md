# Preface

The what and why of leadership is captured on the [*About compsigh leadership* web platform doc](https://compsigh.club/docs/leadership/about). <span style="font-family: Delko">framework</span> is the *how*.

First published by the 2024–2025 leadership team, it would be silly to consider any version a *rulebook*. We can't pretend to know what the leadership team — nor, more importantly, the club members — of several years' future will need.

So, rather than a time capsule, consider this an evergreen account of what works for us, and what might work for the next team. **Everything subject to change, for the sake of the club.**
