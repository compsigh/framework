# Leadership processes

## Criteria for leadership

Inviting a club member to leadership should follow the process described on the [*Joining compsigh leadership* doc on the web platform](https://compsigh.club/docs/leadership/joining).

## Onboarding

Here's what we should do when welcoming a new leadership team member:

- Everyone should have each other's phone numbers, USF email addresses, and calendar availabilities (at least for classes)
- They should be added to the `#leadership` channel in the Discord (via the `@Leadership` role)
- They should be added to all the platforms we use:
  - Instagram
  - GitHub
  - Vercel
  - Figma
  - Resend
  - Luma

## Meetings

The main purpose of club leadership meetings (with everyone on the team in attendance) is a pulse check — on both the team and the community as a whole. e.g. *How was the last compsigh night?* *Is there anything we should address?* *What's the status on the recap post?* *Do you need any help?*

Meetings should happen *in-person*, regularly. The chance there is *nothing* to talk about is near zero. Cadence fluctuates based on the scale of objectives that semester, but weekly or bi-weekly is ideal.

It is standard to have a team member (often the President) take notes at leadership meetings and upload them on the web platform. Everyone should leave the meeting with:

- A clear picture of any todos to be done before the next meeting;
- A rough outline of the next meeting; and
- When it is taking place.

Some agenda items may seem better-suited for a 1:1; however, it's important everyone on the team has at least a high-level understanding of what's going on. A good pulse check for *Does this need to be discussed at a meeting?* is, say a club member asks e.g. "When is compsigh cascade this semester?" all leadership team members should either know the answer to that question, or know how to find the answer without deferring to the President of the club.

## Orientation

At the start of every semester, all of leadership should get together and have a first meeting to get everyone on the same page for the semester. Agenda items often include:

- Addressing any gaps in onboarding, if a new member is joining leadership that semester
- Revisiting notes from the final meeting of the previous semester
- Going over <span style="font-family: Delko">framework</span> and making adjustments as needed
- Going over the primary objectives of the club for the semester (e.g. planning for and/or running DEPLOY)

Orientations are important and also a kind of celebration — we often go out to dinner together afterwards. :)
