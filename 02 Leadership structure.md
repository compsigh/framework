# Leadership structure

As mentioned on the [club leadership web platform docs](https://compsigh.club/docs/leadership/joining), members are invited to join the team rather than applying for it.

Other than President, club leadership members don't really have "positions" (*in fact, until the Fall 2024 semester, the title of President wasn't a thing*). This is because:

1. We prefer to focus on output, and titles don't accurately convey what people do anyway; and
2. We want to enable each other to move around and grow multiple skills, e.g. graphic design one semester, event planning another.

In this sense, all leadership members have an equal voice.

## Roles & responsibilities

All leadership members are expected to:

- **Communicate clearly with the team**, from voicing opinions to letting others know when you can't make an event or meeting
- **Stay in the loop**: keep a pulse check on the community, both online (at least skimming `#general`) and offline
- **Consistently contribute to club objectives**: leadership is not a free ride to a LinkedIn post
- **Be able to attend all the in-person events and leadership meetings**, with very few exceptions

Think of "roles" as output: they tend to coincide with either regular things the club needs done e.g. taking photos at events, or one-off volunteer efforts e.g. writing up the riddles for compsigh cascade, doing the snack run for the week, etc.

### President

The only explicitly defined position in compsigh leadership is President of the club. The President's roles & responsibilities are to:

- Have an intimate understanding of all the club's ongoing objectives and their status: from *Which projects are blocked and why?* to *What's happening at compsigh night next week?*
- Be "the face" of the club: announcements, welcomes, communications between other clubs and departments, etc. are led by the President
- Have a vision and direction for the club
- Confirm new leadership team members
- By the start of the President's final semester at USF, select a successor from the leadership team and begin training them â€” pairing on announcements, CCing them on all communication (if club leadership is not already CCd for whatever reason), etc.
