# Events

## Events structure

There are many different kinds of events the club has hosted in the past. Here are some:

- **One-off workshops** (not on Fridays) e.g. compsigh bit by bit: a panel of hackathon winners sharing advice
- "staging": **regular weekly workshops** (not on Fridays) anyone can host e.g. React & Next.js primer
- "touch grass": monthly (not on Fridays) **off-campus outings** e.g. escape room (paid for by the club)
- Chill, off-campus outings (not on Fridays) (not paid for by the club)
- "technically speaking": **discussions** (not on Fridays) on current events in tech
- "build nights": former iteration of compsigh nights, more emphasis on building stuff
- "compsigh nights": our current **weekly socials**
- "clone": workshops as part of compsigh nights e.g. Get Good at Git with Gursh
- "**demos**" as part of compsigh nights: celebrating what people are working on
- Other cute activities during compsigh nights e.g. tie dye shirt making
- **Collab events** with other clubs e.g. compsigh × ACV × Dons Esports winter night
- "compsigh cascade": **coding riddle competition** (during compsigh nights)
- "DEPLOY": our Fall annual **hackathon** (for a weekend)

And [there are more](https://compsigh.club/events). It's a lot. Some have worked better than others, and that's ok — experimenting is good.

Our current format is compsigh nights: a weekly come-as-you-are, chill social, with snacks and sometimes dinner, that happens every Friday at 6pm, except for holidays and breaks as listed in the [USF Academic Calendar](https://myusf.usfca.edu/registration/when-to-register/academic-calendar). Any other event, except for an off-campus outing, happens *during compsigh night*.

## Brainstorming events

Having a good picture of what's happening on any given compsigh night **at least two weeks out** has worked well. For anything *new* or *more involved* e.g. any event that depends on someone not on leadership, more ahead of time is appropriate.

Community members propose events all the time too, and are often eager to lead the effort e.g. workshops. In such cases, if it's a good fit (vibe check, timing, etc.), we should work with them closely to make it happen.

## Promoting our events

History has shown that if we keep reminding people something is happening, they do show up. There is also a nontrivial amount of CS students who don't know we exist yet. Promo is huge and we should capitalize on any and all hype.

Standard steps for regular events:

1. Create assets (graphics): our current style is pixel art generated with Midjourney. A reliable workflow has been to (1) generate the image in 40:21 aspect ratio (the same used by the web platform); (2) drop it in Figma, layering name, date/time, and location; and (3) crop and scale as needed on platforms e.g. Discord event banners.
2. Write up some good copy for the web platform, the Discord `#events` ping, and the Instagram caption.
3. Add the event to the web platform.
4. Post the graphic on Instagram and something fun on the story (optionally, generate a 9:16 version of the graphic for the story).
5. Ping `@events` in the `#events` channel.

Some additional steps if it's a special (one-off or infrequent) event:

1. Add to Discord Events tab.
2. Reach out to Ella and ask her to announce the event to the CS department over email.
3. (Depending on scale) reach out to professors to promote the event in their classes. *(This is a game-changer.)*
4. Add the event to the CS Events Google Calendar.

## Promoting other events

Generally, messages in `#events` will be pings to `@events` advertising compsigh events. If we're promoting non-compsigh events in `#events`, on our Instagram story, or otherwise, it means we've either been to them before, and/or can endorse them. e.g. Dons Hack, TIAT, etc. We should *not* ping in these instances; the idea is to provide greater visibility than somewhere like `#general`.

Members are free to promote their events or events they're going to in `#general`, provided they're relevant and in good faith. That is, if a user joins the server and their first message is about selling their concert tickets, that doesn't make the cut.

In summary:

| Kind of events                                                                         | Appropriate channel               |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Our club events, e.g. compsigh nights                                                  | `#events`, with ping to `@events` |
| External events we've been to and/or can endorse, e.g. Dons Hack, TIAT, etc.           | `#events`                         |
| External events leadership can't speak on, but are relevant and promoted in good faith | `#general`                        |

## Setup

Day-of compsigh night setup is usually hectic, but manageable. **An hour before** compsigh night is a good start time.

First, we'll want to set up any decorations — we typically have some nice lights, books, tablecloth, etc. and occasionally some cute thematic objects e.g. pumpkins leading up to Halloween/Thanksgiving.

Then, A/V. We have graciously been given access to the Hive projector; the cart can be located in Melanie's office. (As of 2025-01-03, getting our own speaker(s) is a todo.)

Configure chairs and tables as needed. The typical Hive setup tends to be fine for regular compsigh nights.

Lastly, food. Any snacks should be set out either on top of the storage cubbies by the windows (typical for stuff like pizza), or on a separate section (clearly delineated from any decorations) of the long table towards the whiteboard. Make sure people know to eat at the tables such that no decorations get dirtied, and to clean up after themselves.

## Teardown

compsigh nights end when the last people leave — usually at 2am. *Officially*, they end when the last *leadership team member* leaves, which is up to them. It is at that point when teardown should happen — **leadership should not leave the space without completing teardown**. We have a good relationship with our friends at Engineering, and it's important we honor the space we're sharing.

First, clean up any remaining plates, cups, etc. (and feel free to take note of who left them to *kindly* ask them next time to clean up after themselves).

Then, pack up the decorations into our Hive storage cubby or our UC 4th floor locker. Check the `#leadership` Discord channel pinned messages for the up-to-date cubby number and locker combination.

Return borrowed A/V and reset the space if we reconfigured during setup. Ensure all the windows and doors are closed.

Lastly, wipe down all surfaces.

Send a message in `#leadership` when you're done and we're good!

## Running workshops

We've hosted [a variety of events](#Events%20structure), including workshops of different kinds. Regardless of format, workshops are an opportunity for club members to learn from — and teach — each other. They are open for anyone in the club to host (including leadership). As a team, we help them craft and host one that is prepared, high-quality, and helpful.

The first step is to field interest for a workshop, and/or connect with a member who's down to host. Get an idea for what they want to present, and *how* they want to present it (lecture style, build-along, a bit of both, etc.), and make sure it's appropriate (it probably is). Figure out a compsigh night that works for everyone, and get them on the calendar. **This should happen at least three weeks prior.**

Like with most college students, things will come up. Check in with them (ideally **twice a week**, e.g. over Discord) to make sure they're on it and have everything they need. Don't hesitate on this — just sending someone off to prep a workshop will leave them feeling less supported, and also leaves us in the dark.

Feel free to suggest tools for spicing up presentations, such as:

- Canva
- Figma
- Excalidraw
- Ray.so
- Shots.so
- Screen Studio

Slides (or equivalent materials) **should be ready a week before** their scheduled workshop. The presenting club member is invited to that week's Congress (weekly leadership meeting before compsigh night) for feedback, any questions to either of us, how best we can support them, etc.

Finally, on the day of, they come to Congress once more for a final check-in before their workshop.

To summarize:

| Date          | What should be done                                                                                       |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 3 weeks prior | Reach out and get them on the calendar. Inform them of expectations and deadlines.                        |
| 2 weeks prior | Check in. Remind them that slides need to be done by next week                                            |
| 1 week prior  | Has slides done, comes to Congress (leadership meeting before compsigh night) to get feedback on workshop |
| Day of        | Comes to Congress for final check-in, presents during compsigh night                                      |
