Documenting the mission & methods of club leadership

## Editing

To edit the `framework` docs, first clone the repo

```shell
git clone https://github.com/compsigh/framework.git
```

Then you can change directory into the content folder

```shell
cd framework/content
```

Here, are all of the markdown files that house the framework docs.

You can edit these files using your favorite text editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or a dedicated markdown editor like [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)

### Style

Our docs are made with [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) which allows us to use a very expanded set of Markdown with [GH Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

### Local Deployment

You can preview all the changes you make to see what they'll look like on the real site.

> Prerequisites
>
> - [Node](https://nodejs.org) v22
> - `npm` v10.9.2 (comes with node)

Run the server with:

```shell
npm run dev
```

This should build and then print

```
Started a Quartz server listening at http://localhost:8080
```

Then you can open a web browser and go to to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to see a preview of the framework docs!
