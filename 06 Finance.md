# Finance

We track expenses in [our public Notion database](https://www.notion.so/compsigh/expense-tracker-7e1fc8c3a507491e9439cce0d13cb1bc).

Officially, the club president is responsible for expenses and reimbursements. This makes paperwork & other admin responsibilities significantly easier on us. For example:

- *Edward as president:* Gursh buys pizza for compsigh night; Edward reimburses Gursh ASAP; reimbursement funds from a sponsor would go to Edward
- *Jet as president:* Jet pays for a run of poster prints; reimbursement funds from a sponsor would go to Jet

When creating a new entry, make sure all relevant columns are filled in:

- `Expense`: what and why
- `Cost`
- `Date`
- `Who paid`: the leadership member who paid for the expense
    - If it was a non-leadership club member, they should be reimbursed ASAP by a leadership member, whose name should be selected here
- `Status`: whether or not that leadership member has been reimbursed by the president. If the expense was paid for by the president, it represents whether they've been reimbursed by a sponsor.
- `Reimbursement`: eligibility & progress on getting reimbursed for the expense
- `Receipt`: a picture, scan, or download of a receipt
- Add any other relevant details in the entry's page

## Working with the CS Department

We have a compsigh pool under the CS Department's operating funds. People can donate to the University with a memo of "Computer Science Department: compsigh". Once those funds clear, they become available for our use.

Ella maintains a spreadsheet of incoming donations, where we track each one and how soon we can expect them to be available for use. The president, the CS department chair, and Ella should all have access.

When a donation comes in, it usually takes a couple weeks before we know about it. At the start of each semester, it's good to ask Ella to reach out to Development and earmark any compsigh donation and notify us.

At the end of every month, we send Ella a compiled report of expenses we'd like to be reimbursed for from our fund's resources.

The process for spending money and getting reimbursed works like this:

1. We spend our personal money on expenses for the club e.g. food
    - We do have a Plan B for urgent situations where can't spend our own money. Use judiciously and reach out to Ella for details when a situation arises.
2. At the end of every month, the president fills out the [Expense Report for Non-Employees](Expense%20Report%20for%20Non-Employees.pdf):
    - `Payee Name (Last/First) Please Print`: e.g. `Pham/Jet`
    - `Phone`: e.g. `<Jet's phone number>`
    - `Mailing Address`: Harney 402, 2130 Fulton Street, San Francisco, CA 94117
    - `USF Contact Person`: Ella Cartnal, ercartnal@usfca.edu
    - `Contact Phone`: (415) 422-5983
    - For each line item, include `Date`, `Expense item(s)`, and `Amount`; leave the other fields empty
        - If there are more expenses than the line items allow, fill out a second form
    - Enter the `Total Reimbursement`
    - Sign the `Payee Signature`
    - Leave every other field empty
3. Fill out the [Direct Deposit Form for Employee Reimbursement](https://lf.usfca.edu/Forms/DirectDepositUSF)
4. Email to Ella:
    - A filled-out copy of the Expense Report for Non-Employees
    - A single PDF containing all the receipts for the expenses we're requesting reimbursement for, ordered by date (ascending)
    - A filled-out copy of [Form W-9](https://irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw9.pdf)

## Working with E&I

compsigh is a member of the Entrepreneurship & Innovation IDEA Initiative. They provide support in the form of microgrants for club events and member projects. In exchange, we promote fellow Initiative club events when we think they'd be relevant to our community.

Generally, E&I is able to support:

- Larger events like hackathons
- Events that are open to and relevant for all clubs in the Initiative
- Regular expenses related to marketing/promotion of the club, subscriptions to platforms & tools that help club members develop their projects, or those part of a workshop or themed gathering

At the moment, E&I can't fund:

- Regular compsigh night expenses like food
- Expenses greater than $200 month-over-month

The process is similar to working with the CS Department:

1. Reach out to E&I Faculty Director, Professor Jonathan Cromwell jcromwell@usfca.edu; the earlier the better
2. Come to an agreed budget and keep track of expenses closely — we often make a dedicated view in the Notion expense tracker
3. Spend personal funds
4. After the event or at the end of the month, fill out the [Microgrant Reimbursement Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdLx63OmLwH1i82_muf0PEfhyGUv8Qvd0KhMnF4X2uIdZELSg/viewform)
5. Expect to be reimbursed within 2–4 weeks

It's important to keep in touch semi-frequently, even more so for large events. In the past, for example, Edward and John held biweekly check-ins leading up to DEPLOY/24.
