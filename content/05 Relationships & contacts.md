# Relationships & contacts

As a club, we have several relationships — with other clubs, departments, sponsors, etc. It's important we maintain them.

## CS

Of course, the CS department is our biggest ally in upholding the mission of the club.

Regular collaborations with the CS department include:

- Coordinating and making sure we don't host events that conflict with the department or (within reason) the other CS clubs
- "Club Coalition", a monthly meeting of all CS club presidents
- Working with our amazing Program Assistant Jocelyn to promote our upcoming events department-wide (most often to students, but sometimes to faculty for them to promote in their classes — see [Promoting events](04%20Events.md#Promoting%20events))

## Engineering

The Engineering department graciously shares their space with us at the Social Hive. We ask to continue using the space for the following semester towards the end of each one.

## SLE

compsigh is a registered SLE organization. They reach out to "executive members" for regular notices e.g. upcoming fairs we can table at, renewal deadlines, etc. For us, "executive members" means the current President of the club, and either the next President or a leadership team member designated to help manage our relationship with SLE.

See SLE documentation (Canvas course sent to executive members) for info on room reservations, operational rules, etc.

Note that we are _not_ subject to SLE financial rules, as we do not have an account with them/ASUSF. For example, we don't have to ask for permission to host a fundraiser or purchase anything. **All finances are to go through the club, and not SLE.**

In general, we rarely interact with their office, but good reasons to do so include:

- RSVPing for tabling events
- Coordinating campus-wide marketing campaigns e.g. on the TVs
- Making sure all of our paperwork is up-to-date and we are in good standing

## E&I IDEA Initiative

compsigh is a member of the Entrepreneurship & Innovation IDEA Initiative. They provide support in the form of microgrants for club events and member projects. In exchange, we promote fellow Initiative club events when we think they'd be relevant to our community.
