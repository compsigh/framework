# Leadership structure

As mentioned on the [club leadership web platform docs](https://compsigh.club/docs/leadership/joining), members are invited to join the team rather than applying for it.

Club leadership members don't really have "positions", other than President (even that wasn't a thing until Fall 2024). This is because:

1. We prefer to focus on output;
2. Titles don't accurately convey what people do anyway; and
3. We want to enable each other to try new things, learn new skills, and work on what they're interested in. Graphic design one semester, event planning another.

All leadership members have an sense of agency & ownership in the club.

## Roles & responsibilities

All leadership members are expected to:

- **Communicate clearly with the team**, from voicing opinions to letting others know when you can't make an event or leadership meeting
- **Stay in the loop**: keep a pulse check on the community — both offline & online (at least skim `#general`) — and regularly check `#leadership`
- **Consistently contribute to club objectives**: leadership is not a free ride to a LinkedIn post
- **Be able to attend all the in-person events and leadership meetings**, with very few exceptions

Think of "roles" as output: they tend to coincide with either regular things the club needs done e.g. taking photos at events, or one-off volunteer efforts e.g. writing up the riddles for compsigh cascade, doing the snack run for the week, etc.

Examples of regular output ideal to always have people on:

- Photography
- Socials
- Design-engineering for platforms e.g. DEPLOY, cascade, web platform

Note that outputs don't always need a _unique_ set of people; e.g. having a leadership team member both `taking photos at events` and `posting them on Instagram` is reasonable.

We respect weekends and school breaks/holidays. Leadership team members are not expected to put in work during those times (but often do anyway).

### President

The only explicitly defined position in compsigh leadership is President of the club. The President's roles & responsibilities are to:

- Have a strong understanding of all the club's ongoing objectives and each one's status: from _Which projects are blocked and why?_ to _What's happening at compsigh night next week?_
- Be "the face" of the club: announcements, welcomes, communications between other clubs and departments, etc. are led by the President
- Have a vision and direction for the club
- Confirm new leadership team members
- By the start of the President's final semester at USF, select a successor from the leadership team and begin training them — pairing on announcements, CCing them on all communication (if club leadership is not already CCd for whatever reason), introducing them to collaborators and sponsors, etc.
