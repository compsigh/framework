## Criteria for leadership

See the [_Joining compsigh leadership_ doc on the web platform](https://compsigh.club/docs/leadership/joining) for basic criteria and an overview of the invite process.

One point worth highlighting is that a club member should already have a track record of contributions. This can include helping with snack runs, shipping a bug fix on the web platform, etc. If they haven't yet had the chance to contribute, we should help them do so before they join leadership.

## Onboarding

Here's what we should do when welcoming a new leadership team member:

- Everyone should have each other's phone numbers, USF email addresses, and [calendar availabilities](Sharing%20calendar%20availabilities.md)
- They should be added to the `#leadership` channel in the Discord (via the `@leadership` role)
- They should be added to the `Leadership` GitHub team
- Where relevant, they should be added to the other platforms we use regularly:
  - Instagram
  - Vercel
  - Figma

## Meetings

_(Have also been called "congress", "council", etc.)_

The main purpose of club leadership meetings (with everyone on the team in attendance) is a pulse check — on both the team and the community as a whole. e.g. _How was the last compsigh night?_ _What's the status on the recap post?_ _Do you need any help?_

Meetings should happen _in-person_, regularly. The chance there is nothing to talk about is near-zero. We've found weekly before compsigh nights (3:30pm–5pm) is ideal.

It is standard to have a team member (often the President) take notes at leadership meetings and add them to the web platform. Everyone should leave the meeting with:

- A clear picture of any todos to be done before the next meeting;
- A rough outline of the next meeting; and
- When it is taking place.

Some agenda items may seem better-suited for a 1:1; however, it's important everyone on the team has at least a high-level understanding of what's going on. A good example pulse check for _Does this need to be discussed at a meeting?_ is if a club member asks "When is cascade this semester?" (or even "What is cascade?") all leadership team members either know the answer or know how to find it without deferring to someone else.

## Orientation

At the start of every semester, all of leadership should get together and have a first meeting to get everyone on the same page for the semester. Agenda items often include:

- Addressing any gaps in onboarding, if a new member is joining leadership that semester
- Revisiting notes from the final meeting of the previous semester
- Going over <span style="font-family: Delko">framework</span> and making adjustments as needed
- Going over the primary objectives of the club for the semester (e.g. planning for and/or running DEPLOY)

Orientations are important and also a kind of celebration — we often go out to dinner together afterwards. :)
