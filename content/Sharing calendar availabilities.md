title: Sharing calendar availabilities
---
[The state of calendar sucks.](https://x.com/edwardshturman/status/1753209505876455569) It doesn't help that USF's Google Workspace isn't set up for us to view each other's free/busy calendar status. Nevertheless, it's important we're able to easily figure out who's free for (e.g.) a leadership meeting.

Here's how leadership currently runs our personal & team calendars:

- We have a group `compsigh` Google Calendar, to which we add club events and leadership meetings (including meetings that don't include all of leadership â€” we invite who's involved, but this way everyone knows it's happening)
- Most team members prefer we create events on the `compsigh` calendar, then invite each individual involved, so they don't have to see both
- Often, due to existing personal setups, we'll use a team member's personal email account (instead of their USF email) so it fetches the availability already on their calendar
- For personal setups, it's _not_ recommended to have several _calendars_, each for classes, work, etc. because when inviting, events on non-primary calendars are not auto-blocked, so those time slots appear as free (again, the state of calendar sucks)
  - If possible, it's recommended to use _one calendar_ with all relevant times you're busy (classes, work, etc.) blocked on it
    - See this [message from Edward on how to share availability](https://discord.com/channels/849685154543960085/1088341310819283056/1327495467428220958)
    - At minimum please share `free/busy` status with everyone else
